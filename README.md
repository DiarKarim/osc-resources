# [OSC (Open Sound Control)](http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc)
[Qualisys](http://www.qualisys.com) Track Manager realtime server can stream data in Open Sound Control (OSC) format and here we put resources on how to develop OSC clients etc.

The OSCExample in this repository shows how to implement a streaming application using the c# language (Using a OSC communication c# library from [here](http://github.com/ValdemarOrn/SharpOSC)).

[Here](http://www.qualisys.com/applications/other/sound-motion) are some more details regarding the possibilities with Qualisys motion capture and sound.

[Here](https://github.com/qualisys/Real-Time-Protocol-Documentation) is the detailed realtime client streaming documentation that describes the OSC messages in detail.
